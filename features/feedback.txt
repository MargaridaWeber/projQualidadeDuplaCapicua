- Features
--- The 5 features presented describe the mandatory requirements, plus the extra feature that implies sending email
--- The scenarios provide the "free text" search

- Scenarios
--- Several scenarios are extremely generic. "introduces some keyworks" / "should expands the filters" (where is the test
t assert that all the filters are available?
#AN EXAMPLE - ONE OF YOUR TESTS RE-WRITTEN
 Scenario Outline: The profile card is incomplete
  Given it is not possible to show <data>
  When the user accesses the site
  Then the system should show <nodata>
  Examples:
   | data | nodata |
   | photo | imagedefault.jpg |
   | name | Anónimo |
   | job | Não é possiível mostrar! |
   | workplace | Não é possiível mostrar! |


- Gherkin
--- Consistency should be achieved (the feature "search a profile card" uses expressions like "introduces some keywords" when in
other scenarios of other features, there are specific examples of what can be used - eg. name, photo, URLs...)
--- Found no backgrounds nor scenario outlines. Could have used them.
--- Examples tables are provided after "Scenario:" and should be provided after "Scenario Outline:" and are not even
referred as "Examples:"


Version Control System Usage
- Commit messages are short and almost too-short to be self describing
--- What was the update conducted in the commit "English Words v2"?
- One of the members of the team does not appear as contributor of the repository
--- A balanced throughput of the commits shows an equally distributed work load
